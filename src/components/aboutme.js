        <p id="p">Front-end web developer with a content-writing and poetry background to offer clients full website
          services. I recently enrolled in and completed a full-stack development “Coding Bootcamp” at The George
          Washington University, earning a certificate in full-stack development and newly-developed skills in HTML,
          CSS, Responsive Web Design, JavaScript, jQuery, among others. </p>
          <p id="p">My goal is to engage users through web and app
          design for an impactful user experience, as I am a problem-solver, passionate about app and web page building
          and design. In addition to writing for the We Are Not Numbers organization, I collaborated and worked with its
          team and developed the organization’s website. I also have independently worked on various projects aimed at
          developing tools to help users navigate their daily lives, including quizzes, simple games, calculators, and
          calendars. I look forward to applying the skills I have cultivated to increase web efficiency and enhance the
          overall user experience.</p>
